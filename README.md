# Creo Script

This script takes screenshots of .pvz models. It uses Creo View Express to display models.   

## Info

In order for the script to run properly, .pvz models must be put into 'models' folder. 

The script then proceeds to create a folder named 'screenshots' where the screenshots taken are stored. 

"Press enter to quit" prompt is used solely for the purpose of making an executable file later, which displays info in the terminal.
Without this prompt, the terminal simply closes the second the script is finished, which gives no time for the user to read what happens/happened.

## Dependencies

* Python Pillow library for taking screenshots.
* Creo View Express software

## Executing script

* In terminal execute:
```
python creoproject.py
```
